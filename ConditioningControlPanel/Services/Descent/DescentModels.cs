    // ============================================================================
    // THE DESCENT — typed shape of the server's `descent` block.
    //
    // Wire truth: ccp-server proxy/descent-block.js (composeDescentBlock). The
    // block rides INSIDE the `user` object of GET /v2/user/profile (server.js
    // :14334, `user: await attachDescentBlocks({...})`) and is attached ONLY when
    // DESCENT_BLOCK is armed AND the account passes DESCENT_BLOCK_STAGE (whitelist
    // today). Everyone else gets a byte-identical response with no `descent` key.
    //
    // THE TRI-STATE LAW, and it is not negotiable: key absent => render NOTHING.
    // Malformed => render NOTHING. Only a well-formed block draws a vat. There is
    // no demo dataset on desktop and no local fabrication from client-side XP —
    // a staged rollout is only invisible if the excluded cannot tell they are
    // excluded, and a vat filled from un-synced local XP is a number the server
    // never agreed to.
    //
    // Every reader lives in DescentReader; nothing else may trust a payload.
    // ============================================================================
