# Conditioning Control Panel - Project Context

## Overview
A WPF desktop application (.NET 8, Windows-only) that provides a conditioning/hypnosis control panel with various features including flash images, videos, AI avatar companion, achievement system, and more.

## Build & Run
```bash
cd ConditioningControlPanel
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

## Quick File Reference

### Version Locations (ALL must be updated for releases)
| File | What |
|------|------|
| `ConditioningControlPanel.csproj:12` | `<Version>` tag |
| `Services/Update/UpdateService.cs:~23` | `AppVersion` constant |
| `Services/Update/UpdateService.cs:~29` | `CurrentPatchNotes` |
| `../installer.iss:16` | `MyAppVersion` |
| `../build-installer.bat:10` | `VERSION` |
| `MainWindow/MainWindow.xaml:~1985` | `BtnUpdateAvailable` Content + ToolTip loc keys |
| `Localization/Languages/*.json` (9 files) | `btn_vX_Y_Z_is_out` + `tooltip_vX_Y_Z_*` keys |

Use `/release X.Y.Z "Subtitle"` to automate this. Also write `../release-notes/notes-vX.Y.Z.txt` (plain-text notes for the GitHub release; no em-dashes). After signing: push main, tag `vX.Y.Z`, create the GitHub release (mark Latest), POST server marquee + update-banner (`x-admin-token`), update download links + version badge in `C:\Projects\cclabs-site` (index.html + guide-getting-started.html, then commit+push and `vercel deploy --prod`), announce on Discord. The language files are strict-JSON clean as of 2026-07-29 - see **Localization** under Known Issues before editing them.

### Important Paths
| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `logs/crash.log` | Crash logs with stack traces - CHECK THIS FIRST |
| `%LOCALAPPDATA%/ConditioningControlPanel/` | User data, settings, tokens (`App.UserDataPath`) |
| `%LOCALAPPDATA%/ConditioningControlPanel/assets/` | Default assets folder (`App.UserAssetsPath`) |
| `%LOCALAPPDATA%/ConditioningControlPanel/emi-desk.json` | EMI Desk's runtime ledger (parked position, pins, usage scores, dealt lines) - real user state, back it up before testing |
| `App.EffectiveAssetsPath` | User's chosen assets folder (or default) |
| `../docs/` | GitHub Pages website |
| `../releases/` | Velopack release output |
| `../installer-output/` | Inno Setup installer output |

> **Server code** lives in private repo `CC-Labs-llc/CCP-Server`. See that repo's docs for endpoints, deployment, and admin operations.

## Common Tasks

### Debug a Crash
1. Check `logs/crash.log` for stack trace
2. Search for the exception type in codebase
3. Common culprits: null references in async callbacks, WPF resource lookup failures

### Add a New Setting
1. Add property to `Models/AppSettings.cs` with `[JsonProperty]`
2. Add UI control in `MainWindow.xaml` (usually in Settings tab)
3. Bind to `App.Settings.Current.YourProperty`

### Add a New Service
1. Create `Services/YourService.cs`
2. Add static property in `App.xaml.cs`: `public static YourService? YourService { get; private set; }`
3. Initialize in `App.OnStartup()` after other services

### Add a New Achievement
1. Add the entry to `Models/Achievement.cs` (`Achievement.All`) + art in `Resources/achievements/`
2. Add loc keys `achievement_<id>_name/_req/_flavor` to the 9 `Localization/Languages/*.json` files
3. **Server side or the Discord post silently never happens:** add the id to
   `ccp-server` `proxy/data/achievements.json` (name/requirement/image/flavor, optional
   per-mod `flavor_overrides`) - the webhook 400s unknown ids
4. Upload the PNG (+256px webp sibling) to `cclabs-site/achievements/` and deploy - the
   bot hotlinks `https://cclabs.app/achievements/<image>`

### Release a New Version
Use `/release X.Y.Z "Subtitle"` - it covers all version locations, patch notes, localization keys, and
the Discord announce step. Version locations are also tabulated above under **Version Locations**.

(`../RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md` was removed from this public repo in `13eae254`; the skill is now the source
of truth.)

## Project Structure

### Key Files
- **App.xaml.cs** - Application entry point, initializes all services (Flash, Video, Audio, Subliminal, etc.), manages static service instances
- **MainWindow.xaml/.cs** - Main UI with multiple tabs (Flashes, Videos, Overlays, Subliminals, Sessions, Progression, Settings)
- **AvatarTubeWindow.xaml/.cs** - AI companion avatar window that can be attached/detached from main window, handles speech bubbles, animations, and AI interactions

### Services (Services/)
- **FlashService.cs** - Handles flash image display with GIF animation support, uses images from `App.EffectiveAssetsPath/images`
- **VideoService.cs** - Handles mandatory video playback with attention checks, uses videos from `App.EffectiveAssetsPath/videos`
- **AudioService.cs** - Audio ducking and playback management
- **SubliminalService.cs** - Subliminal text/image overlay display
- **OverlayService.cs** - Screen overlays (BrainDrain blur, edge effects, etc.)
- **BubbleService.cs** - Floating bubble popping minigame
- **BubbleCountService.cs** - Bubble counting video minigame (Level 50+)
- **SessionEngine.cs** - Deterministic session runtime (1-second timer that coordinates feature start/end times and ramps from a Session's settings). NOT AI-powered and makes no network/OpenRouter calls - see `docs/primers/SESSION_PRESET_PRIMER.md`
- **ProgressionService.cs** - XP and leveling system
- **AchievementService.cs** - Achievement tracking and unlocks
- **UpdateService.cs** - Auto-update via GitHub Releases API + Inno Setup silent installer
- **PatreonService.cs** - Patreon OAuth, subscription validation, whitelist (server-side)
- **ContentPackService.cs** - Download/install encrypted content packs
- **EmiDesk/** - EMI Desk, the summoned desktop widget (`App.EmiDesk`): ring, glass, preset-line engine, avatar-mute arbiter. See `docs/primers/EMI_DESK_PRIMER.md`

### Models (Models/)
- **AppSettings.cs** - All application settings with INotifyPropertyChanged, auto-saves to JSON
- **CompanionPromptSettings.cs** - AI companion personality customization
- **Session.cs** - Session data model
- **PatreonModels.cs** - Patreon API response models, cache state

### Key Patterns
- Services are accessed via static properties on `App` class: `App.Flash`, `App.Video`, `App.Audio`, `App.Patreon`, etc.
- Settings via `App.Settings.Current` (AppSettings instance)
- Assets path: `App.EffectiveAssetsPath` returns custom path if set, else default `App.UserAssetsPath`
- User data in `%LOCALAPPDATA%/ConditioningControlPanel/` (`App.UserDataPath`, via `SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData`)
- Patreon features gated by `App.Patreon?.HasPremiumAccess` or `App.Patreon?.HasAiAccess`

### UI Architecture
- Dark theme with pink/purple accent colors (#FF69B4, #252542, #1A1A2E)
- Custom styles in MainWindow.xaml Resources section
- Tab-based navigation with animated icons
- Avatar tube window positions relative to main window when attached
- Converters must be in Window.Resources (not local Grid.Resources) to work in DataTemplates

## Known Issues & Solutions

### WPF Issues
1. **Crash on resize**: Wrap in try-catch, use `SizeToContent = Manual` before layout changes
2. **Null template on animation**: Check `btn.IsLoaded` and `btn.Template != null` before animations
3. **Duplicate windows**: Only one StartupUri OR manual window creation in App.xaml.cs, not both
4. **Resource not found in DataTemplate**: Move converters/resources to Window.Resources, not local Grid.Resources
5. **Screen enumeration crash**: Always check `Screen.AllScreens.Length > 0` before accessing - can return empty during certain system states
6. **Never hardcode a risky font family; a comma fallback is NOT a guard.** A user's corrupt
   Cascadia install made every panel render blank in v6.8.6: WPF threw
   `UnauthorizedAccessException` from `FontFamily.GetFirstMatchingFont` inside
   `TextBlock.MeasureOverride`, i.e. from the LAYOUT pass, so it re-threw on every measure and
   crash.log reached ~0.5GB in one session. Every Cascadia site already named
   `"Cascadia Mono, Consolas, Courier New"` at the time - a chain only rescues an ABSENT family,
   because deciding whether the first link matches means opening the font file, and that open is
   what throws. The monospace face now lives in ONE place, App.xaml's `Font.Mono`, bound with
   **DynamicResource** (never StaticResource - that snapshots at parse time);
   `Services/UI/FontGuard` probes the risky families at startup and strikes any unreadable one out
   of every chain. `FontFallbackTests` fails the build if markup names Cascadia directly or names
   Consolas/Impact/Segoe MDL2/Segoe UI Emoji with nothing behind it.

### Async/Threading Issues
7. **Fire-and-forget Task crashes**: Always wrap `Task.Delay().ContinueWith()` callbacks with `if (Application.Current?.Dispatcher == null) return;` and try-catch
8. **MainWindow null during session**: SessionEngine holds reference to MainWindow - use `IsMainWindowValid` check before calling window methods
9. **Event handlers on closed windows**: Check `Application.Current.Dispatcher.HasShutdownStarted` before triggering UI operations in event handlers

### Build Issues
10. **Velopack "Access denied"**: Delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\Velopack` folder and retry
11. **Build warnings about Screen**: These are CA1416 platform warnings - safe to ignore for Windows-only app

### Localization
12. **Never put a literal line break inside a language-file string.** Until 2026-07-29, 8 of the 9 `Localization/Languages/*.json` files carried raw newlines inside 38 tooltip values, so only Newtonsoft's leniency parsed them - `System.Text.Json`, `jq`, Python and most format-on-save tools rejected all 8. They are now escaped as `\n`/`\r\n` and every file parses strictly. Keep it that way: write `\n`, not an actual newline.
13. **A dead language file no longer empties the UI.** `LocalizationManager.LoadLanguageFile` returns an empty dictionary on failure; `SetLanguage` treats that as "fall back to English", and `EnsureFallbackLoaded` logs **Fatal** if `en.json` itself fails (the one case with nothing to fall back to - the UI then renders raw keys like `btn_start_flashes`). If you see that Fatal line, the language file is broken, not the UI.
14. **Don't hand-flip language-file line endings.** All 9 `Localization/Languages/*.json` are LF in git; the worktree shows CRLF only because `core.autocrlf=true` converts on checkout. Let autocrlf do its job and never commit a whole-file line-ending diff.

### EMI Desk
15. **The outfit / skin layer is the TOPMOST thing in EMI's composition.** It is drawn above the
    face and above the takeover glass; face art may never paint over a garment. Her face is not
    part of the body PNG - it is a canvas laid over the glass rect, with the glass a second canvas
    on the same rect - so anything a coat, a collar or a pair of goggles draws across that rect is
    buried behind two layers of her own face unless the garment gets a layer of its own in front
    of them (owner report, 2026-08-30: "the coat behind the screen, it should be over it"). On the
    desk that is `OutfitOverImage`, authored AFTER `FaceLayer` inside `BodyRoot` in
    `Windows/EmiDesk/EmiDeskWindow.xaml`; on the web it is `.emi-over` at `z-index: 2`. Sheets
    follow one naming contract on both sides: `art/emi/<outfit>/over-<pose file>.png` beside
    `art/emi/<outfit>/<pose file>.png`, optional, and silent when absent. `EmiDeskLayerOrderTests`
    pins the desk's order, so a XAML edit that reorders those two nodes fails the suite instead of
    shipping a buried collar.

## Architecture Notes

### Initialization Order (App.OnStartup)
1. Logger (Serilog)
2. Settings (AppSettings.Load)
3. Core services (Flash, Video, Audio, Subliminal, Overlay)
4. Patreon service (async validation)
5. Update service (async check)
6. MainWindow creation
7. Optional services (Autonomy, Discord, etc.)

### Patreon/Whitelist Flow
1. User logs in via OAuth -> tokens stored encrypted (DPAPI)
2. `PatreonService.ValidateSubscriptionAsync()` called on startup
3. Server returns subscription tier + `is_whitelisted` flag
4. `HasPremiumAccess` / `HasAiAccess` properties gate features
5. Results cached for 24 hours

### Update Flow
1. `UpdateService.CheckForUpdatesAsync()` on startup hits the GitHub Releases API
2. Compares `AppVersion` constant with the `tag_name` of the latest release
3. If newer: shows `UpdateNotificationDialog`
4. On install: downloads the `Setup.exe` asset from the release and runs it silently with `/SILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /CLOSEAPPLICATIONS /RESTARTAPPLICATIONS` so Inno Setup upgrades the existing install in place
5. Fallback: server marquee/banner notifies users whose check failed
6. Velopack was retired in v5.8.4 (the in-app `UpdateManager` had been bypassed since v5.4.10's switch to Inno Setup)
